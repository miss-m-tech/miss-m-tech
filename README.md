### 🧠 About Me
Hi, I’m **Michelle** — a creative technologist and lifelong learner based in Melbourne, Australia.  
I blend technology, design, and self-expression to build tools, apps, and art that empower people.

💬 I’m currently exploring:
- **Cyber Security practices** (Unix/Linux, Docker, Access Control)
- **Web Development & APIs** (HTML, CSS, JS, Firebase, Cloud Run)
- **AI & Data Science** (Python, Pandas, Jupyter)
- **Creative projects** that merge IT, wellbeing, and design

🪴 Outside of tech:
- I run a creative brand — *Miss M: Modern Muse by Moonlight* — exploring softness, style, and self-love.  
- I’m a mum, volunteer, and advocate for neurodiverse and authentic living.
